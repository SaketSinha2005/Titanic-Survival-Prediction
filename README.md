# Titanic Survival Prediction Mode

A machine learning project that predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using logistic regression. The dataset contains passenger details such as age, gender, ticket class, and fare. The project involves:

- Performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand patterns and survival trends.
- Preprocessing data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
- Training and evaluating a **Logistic Regression** classifier using cross-validation and accuracy metrics.


## Acknowledgements

- **Kaggle** for hosting the Titanic dataset.
- **scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib** communities for documentation and tools.
- Tutorials and open-source contributors who inspired the workflow.


## Appendix

This workflow is not restricted to the Titanic dataset. It can be reused for **any binary classification problem** with similar preprocessing needs. By swapping the dataset and adjusting preprocessing steps, you can easily adapt it to other problems like spam detection, loan approval prediction, or disease diagnosis.

## Demo
The project runs entirely in a Python environment. Output includes:

- EDA plots generated by Matplotlib (survival distribution, age histograms, class vs. survival).
- Accuracy score of the trained model printed to console.
- Optionally, confusion matrix and classification report for deeper evaluation.

## Documentation
**Workflow Steps:**

1. **Load Dataset** — Read CSV data using Pandas.
2. **EDA** — Visualize and summarize distributions, missing values, and survival trends.

3. **Data Preprocessing**

- Handle missing values with SimpleImputer

- Encode categorical variables with OneHotEncoder

- Scale numerical features with StandardScaler

4. **Model Training** — Logistic Regression classifier.

5. **Model Evaluation** — Cross-validation and accuracy score.
## Features

- Predicts Titanic passenger survival based on personal and ticket attributes.
- Clean preprocessing pipeline using scikit-learn transformers.
- Includes EDA visualizations for data insights.
- Modular design for easy adaptation to new datasets.

## Results

- Achieved **93.78% accuracy** using Logistic Regression with cross-validation.
- Key insights from EDA:

    - Females had a significantly higher survival rate than males.

    - First-class passengers had better survival chances compared to second and third class.
